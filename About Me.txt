How it works 
This program performs a simple linguistic analysis on the text entered in the box.
Two basic work streams are provided one where you can enter multiple texts and submit them for analyses. The second is used for displaying the report of either one or of all the text submitted for analysis. 

Technical information
This program reads the text provided and splits out all the words which are entered an array. The program cunts the number of occurrences of each word to generate the report, which is then displayed in the main textbox of the application.
